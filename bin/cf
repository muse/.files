# An very easy 1339.cf uploader for the command line. It was originally
# created for pomf which has been taken down by the owner. 
# (Goodnight sweet prince) 

VERSION=0.2
NAME=cf

# Find out that some things aren't working? Follow these stepts to ensure
# I am not at fault.
# 1. Have a internet connection, I know it may sound silly but some people
#    just don't have it or forget that they aren't currently connected.
# 2. Export the $BROWSER variable when using the -w flag. This relies on you
#    exporting that variable to know what browser to force the file in.
# 3. The specified file or paste is not bigger than 100MB or rarely 50MB.
# 4. Make sure the $LOG and $IMG variable paths are existant.
#    If this is not the case moving the file could cause problems to the script.
# 5. Don't forget to install the required packages, the names may vary
#    for the different operating systems.

    cf - an 1339.cf uploading tool. 

$(tput bold)FLAGS$(tput sgr0)
    $(tput bold)-u, --upload$(tput sgr0)
        Upload the <argument> file. This throws away the \`-s\` & \`-f\` flags.
        You can however save the file locally and write it to the logfile.
        
    $(tput bold)-f, --fullscreen$(tput sgr0)
        Create a fullscreen screenshot, this takes a screenshot of all the-
        available and active monitors. If you want to take a screenshot of only-
        the current window; you can use \`-s\` to select the entire screen.

    $(tput bold)-s, --selection$(tput sgr0)
        Take a selection based screenshot. Select an area with the mouse after-
        the script is ran. Release to automatically upload the data.

    $(tput bold)-b, --browser$(tput sgr0)
        This will open the just created screenshot or already existant file-
        in the browser that is exported as \$BROWSER.

    $(tput bold)-l, --logfile$(tput sgr0)
        Write the succesfully uploaded url to the \$LOG variable path.

    $(tput bold)-o, --offline$(tput sgr0)
        Create an local copy of the uploaded file.

    $(tput bold)-h, --help$(tput sgr0)
        Display this.

    $(tput bold)-v, --version$(tput sgr0)
        Show the current version.

$(tput bold)ISSUES$(tput sgr0)
    The following points are also addressed in the source of the code.
    
    *  Have a internet connection, I know it may sound silly but some people
       just don't have it or forget that they aren't currently connected.

    *  Export the \$BROWSER variable when using the -w flag. This relies on you
       exporting that variable to know what browser to force the file in.

    *  The specified file or paste is not bigger than 100MB or rarely 50MB.

    *  Make sure the \$LOG and \$IMG variable paths are existant.
       If this is not the case moving the file could cause problems to the script.

    *  Don't forget to install the required packages, the names may vary
       for the different operating systems.
